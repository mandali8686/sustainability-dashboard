        <h2>What is Compost/Recycling</h2>
      <h3>Compost</h3>
      <p>Composting is the natural process of turning organic material into a nutrient-rich soil conditioner, which is a great and sustainable way to recycle kitchen and garden waste. It significantly reduces the amount of waste sent to landfill and provides an excellent soil additive. In the Vanderbilt context, food scraps from dining halls, and organic waste from labs or gardens could be collected and sent to a composting facility.</p>
      <h3>Recycling</h3>
      <p>Recycling involves collecting, processing, and converting waste materials into new products. This reduces the amount of waste that goes to landfills, conserves natural resources, and saves energy. On the Vanderbilt campus, you'll find designated bins for materials like paper, plastic, metal, and glass, which are then collected and sent to recycling centers.</p>
      <h2>Where does Compost/Recycling Go?</h2>
      <h3>Composting</h3>
      <h4>On-Campus Facilities: </h4>
      <p>Some universities have their own composting facilities. The composted material may be used on campus gardens and green spaces.</p>
      <h4>Local Farms or Facilities: </h4>
      <p>More commonly, organic waste for composting is collected and transported to a local composting facility or farm, where it's turned into soil conditioner or fertilizer.</p>
      <h3>Recycling:</h3>
      <h4>Recycling Centers:</h4>
      <p>Materials like paper, plastic, metal, and glass are usually sorted on-site and then sent to local or regional recycling centers for further processing.</p>
      <h4>Specialized Facilities:</h4>
      <p>Some materials may require specialized recycling facilities. For example, electronic waste is often sent to facilities equipped to safely handle and recycle these materials.</p>
